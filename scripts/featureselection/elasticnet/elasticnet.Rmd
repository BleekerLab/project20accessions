This script performs elastic net regression to identify relevant features (mostly RNA-Seq data and phenotypes)

# Load libraires
```{r}
library(glmnet)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
